# SmartBudget-MVP
Student-focused personal finance dashboard that helps users track expenses, set budgets, and build healthier money habits. This project is the minimum viable prototype (MVP) of a web-based budgeting tool built with **React**, **Flask**, and **Firebase**.

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Create an accessible, intuitive platform for students and young professionals to:
- Track expenses and categorize spending
- Set savings goals and budgets
- Receive real-time alerts and spending suggestions
- Visualize financial trends with charts and analytics

## Business Problem

Many students and early-career professionals struggle with financial literacy and overspending. Existing tools (like PocketGuard and EveryDollar) are often either too complex, too expensive, or lack customization. **SmartBudget-MVP** aims to close that gap with a user-friendly tool focused on simplicity, personalization, and actionable insights.
